The RDM4mic meeting, held October 21-22, 2025, focused on research data management for bioimage data, particularly concerning OMERO and ELN integration.

### Key Topics & Discussions:

*   **Expectations & Needs:** Participants expressed interest in best practices, workflow appraisal, OMERO onboarding, ELN integration, new tools, and networking. Missing elements included SSO,
    server-side processing, data analysis/archiving tools, data transfer between OMERO servers, metadata integrity checks, and dropdown menus in OMERO key-value pairs.
*   **Training & Resources:** Training materials from [i3D:bio](https://zenodo.org/records/8323588) and [NFDI4Bioimage](https://nfdi4bioimage.github.io/training/readme.html) were highlighted. The [NFDI4Bioimage HelpDesk}(https://nfdi4bioimage.de/help-desk/) and [CAi-workflow for OMERO onboarding](https://zenodo.org/records/14988921) were presented. 
The importance of data publication (raw data) was discussed, alongside challenges with tracking reuse and incentivizing scientists.
*   **OMERO Focus:**  A public OMERO instance ([https://omero-nfdi.uni-muenster.de](https://omero-nfdi.uni-muenster.de)) was showcased, offering easy access and a test environment. 
Discussion revolved around community requirements for updates, plugin management, and data management/security.  The Helmholtz Imaging platform ([https://helmholtz-imaging.de/](https://helmholtz-imaging.de/)) and its OMERO instance were also presented.
*   **Metadata & ELN Integration:**  The importance of metadata standards, RO-Crates, and tools like OMERO.mde and LEO were emphasized.  
Challenges included ontology limitations, manual linking between tools (elab, ResearchDrive, OMERO), and the need for a unified ELN integration approach.
*   **Workflow Automation:**  There was a strong push towards automating import workflows using tools like Nextflow, with a decision to avoid creating new import repositories and to focus on leveraging existing frameworks.
*   **Tooling & Infrastructure:** The need for a central “app store” for OMERO tools and improved assessment of tool usefulness was noted.  SSO implementation was a major concern.
