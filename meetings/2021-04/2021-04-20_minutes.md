## For beginners...
#### Participants: 29
- Thomas Zobel(TZ): Introduction OMERO setup at muenster
    - Roland: someone employed to supervise the installation?

        - TZ: from outside
    - Andreas:
    - Luiz:
- Peter Zentis(PZ): Introduction OMERO setup at CECAD
- [ ] open questions: from Angela (to Thomas): 
You said all new user end first up in  default group and could mess up this storage place.
Would it be possible in your setup that you restrict the temporary group from the rights to upload data there, so so that they notice that they cannot work and actively get in contact to you.
If you have no backup and the user have there data also on other drives are they nevertheless consequently only working with their data in Omero and not also on local computers?
